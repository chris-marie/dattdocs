Datt Community Member Roles
===========================

## Goal ##
Determine the basic roles within the Datt community and establish the general and Base User Knowledge required to participate.
This can be used to generate Datt help, wiki's, and FAQ's later for app participants.

### Authors
  - Using a standard **posting dashboard**
    - Creating posts
    - Editing Posts
    - Deleting posts (or why they cannot *actually* delete posts.
    - Adding media
  - Sharing posts / their "channels"
  - What is legal and not legal: assuming authors want to make money on app legally.
  - **Content Ownership**: here is what you can do with us that you can't with facebook, reddit, youtube, twitter
    - Payments
    - Post Repositories: downloading contents, contacts, comments
    - Basic statistics for content creators

### Moderators
  - Using a standard **moderator dashboard**
    - Ex: title, desription, language, content options, wiki
  - How to filter spam
  - What is legal and not legal: assuming moderators want to make money on app legally.

### Nodes Operators
  - Legality side
  - Technical side
  - Getting moderators

### Commentors
  This is more of a pseudo role because commenting is a form of content.  In the simplest version, requiring the least amount of base user knowledge, comments maybe are only differentiated by a tag relating to the responding post, but are accessed in the author dashboard.
  The other option, which is less like the way reddit is now, is similar to stack exchange / stack overflow where only 'answers' are easily accessed via dashboard.
