## About Datt

Datt is a social media application where the users own their content and pay each other for quality content, moderation, and hosting. It does not depend on a central organization has no central point of failure.

Datt stands for "decentralize all the things."


## Our Goal

To prove the feasibility of a P2P publishing market where content ownership remains with the author and moderation choice remains with the user.


## FAQ

**How do I *own content* and how is that different from current social media platforms (ie Reddit, Facebook, LinkedIn etc.)?**

 Owning content means that no one can take access to that content away from you. It also means that when that content is sold, you get payed for it. 
 
 Current social media platforms such as Reddit, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, and others sell your content all the time and the do not need to pay you for it.  They can also delete, change, or otherwise revoke your access to your own content at anytime.

**Why is Datt peer-2-peer?**

 It's important that content published to Datt can be distributed widely and freely without a central organization having control. While it would be easier to centralize or federate content between servers, this would not achieve our goals. 
 
 **Do I need to install anything?**
 
 No. The basic Datt client will run as a web app in your browser. We expect mobile apps and advanced clients will be developed at a later stage. 
 
 **How will users have choice over content moderation?**
 
 Users can apply their own content filters, or subscribe to collectives where moderators have curated content. Users can select as little or as many collectives to filter the content you most want to see. 
 
 **Other than free speach, what are the benefits of using Datt over all other platforms?**
 
 We've worked out a model that benefits everyone who participates on the network - Authors, Moderators, Node Operators, and Commenters can all benefit from Bitcoin micropayments. We'll announce more on this soon.
