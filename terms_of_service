## Terms Modifications

We can change these Terms at any time. If the changes are material, we’ll let you know by email, tweeting, or posting a notice on the site before the changes go into effect. The notice will designate a reasonable amount of time (the “Notice Period”) after which the new terms will go into effect for all users. If you don’t agree to the new terms, please delete your account within the Notice Period. If you do not delete your account within the Notice Period, your content and use of the site will be subject to the new terms going forward.

You can access historical versions of our Terms of Service and other policies [here coming soon](https://github.com/dattnetwork/dattdocs).


## Services Modifications

We may modify our Services at any time
We do our best to provide you a reliable and evolving service, but we may change, terminate, or restrict access to any aspect of the service, at any time, without notice.


## Privacy

When you use Datt Services, you consent to the collection and use of information as detailed in our [Privacy Policy (link comming soon)](https://github.com/dattnetwork/dattdocs). If you’re outside the United States, you consent to the transfer, storage, and processing of your information—including but not limited to the content you posted or transferred to the site and any personal information—to and within the United States and other countries.

Please read about how Datt's decentralization affects your privacy and content [here (coming soon)[http://dattnetwork.github.io/datt.co/].


## Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”)

Due to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, Datt is only for people 13 years old and over. If you’re under 13, we’re sorry, but you’re not allowed here. If we learn a child under 13 is using Datt we will terminate the child’s account. If you believe that a child under 13 may have a presence on Datt, please [contact us](http://dattnetwork.github.io/datt.co/) and we will remove it. 


## Miscellaneous
You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that Datt may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit.
